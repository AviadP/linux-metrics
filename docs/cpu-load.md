# CPU Matrics

## CPU Load

### Recall: Linux Process State
From `man 1 ps`:

```
D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
R    running or runnable (on run queue)
S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
T    stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is being traced
Z    defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent
```
